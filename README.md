# Ethanol_microbiota
This project is related to the article "Drinking pattern and sex modulate the impact of ethanol consumption on the mouse gut microbiome". Mostly of codes can be found here. 

# PcoA analysis (Figure 03)

PcoA's plots from qiime 2.0 were modified in R. The code can be found in "PcoA_rarefaction_curve_modified.html" file. The datasets from the analysis are in .qza format.

# Heatmap (Figure 05)

The heatmap can be visualized in the file "heatmap_Carla_update.html". The original datasets can be found as normalized_genus FEMEAS.csv and normalized_genus MACHOS.csv for female and male, respectively.

# Lefse analysis

The lefse analysis was done in lefser package. 

# Barplot for male and female (Figures 07 and 08)

The visualization of codes and figures 7 and 8 from barplot of relative abundance from male and female can be found in male_barplot.html and female_barplot.html, respectively. The original datasets from male and female barplots can be visualized in male_modified.csv and female_modified.csv, respectively.

# Rarefaction curve (Figure S1)

Rarefaction curve was modified in R and the result can be visualized in the file "PcoA_rarefaction_curve_modified.html". Original datasets are named as "shannon_male.csv" and "shannon_female.csv" for male and female, respectively.
