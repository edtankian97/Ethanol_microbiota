# Ethanol_microbiota
This project is related to the article **Drinking pattern and sex modulate the impact of ethanol consumption on the mouse gut microbiome**. Mostly of codes can be found here. 

# PcoA analysis (Figure 03)

PcoA's plots from qiime 2.0 were modified in R. The code can be found in **PcoA_rarefaction_curve_modified.html** file. The datasets from the analysis are in .qza format.

# Heatmap (Figure 05)

The heatmap can be visualized in the file **heatmap_Carla_update.html**. The original datasets can be found as **normalized_genus FEMEAS.csv** and **normalized_genus MACHOS.csv** for female and male, respectively.

# Lefse analysis (Figure 06)

The lefse analysis was done in lefser package. Code can be view in **lefse_analysis_lefser.R** file. Original dataset are named as **normalized_genus Male C versus EtCr.csv**, 

# Barplot for relative abundance in male and female (Figures 07 and 08)

Code with barplots of relative abundance of bacterias in male and female mice can be visualized in **relative_abundance.ipynb**. Raw results of statistical analysis are in separated files: 
**Kruskal_male_result_abundance.tsv** and **Kruskal_female_result_abundance.tsv** for male and female, respectively.

# Rarefaction curve (Figure S1)

Rarefaction curve was modified in R and the result can be visualized in the file "PcoA_rarefaction_curve_modified.html". Original datasets are named as **shannon_male.csv** and **shannon_female.csv** for male and female, respectively.

# Barplot for male and female (Figures S7 and S8)

The visualization of codes and figures S7 and S8 from barplot of prediction's pathway from male and female can be found in **male_barplot_script.html** and **female_barplot.html**, respectively. The original datasets from male and female barplots can be visualized in **male_modified.csv** and **female_modified.csv**, respectively.
